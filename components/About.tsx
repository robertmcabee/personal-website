        <p className="pt-4">
          I&#39;m from Bozeman, MT. When I&#39;m not coding I love hiking,
          listening to music and video games.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4">
          I switched careers from title insurance to tech to challenge myself
          and do what I love. From the title industry, I learned to work with a
          team and coordinate with clients with to meet high standards of
          professionalism and detail.
